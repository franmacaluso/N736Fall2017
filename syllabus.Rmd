## COURSE NUMBER, TITLE:
NRSG 741, Big Data Analytics for Healthcare

## PRE-/CO-REQUISITES:			
BIOS 500 and 501	

## CREDIT ALLOCATION:		
3 credit hours

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course will describe the concepts underlying the field of study identified as big data analytics along with its application in healthcare. The theoretical underpinnings of these concepts will be presented along with applications in healthcare, including knowledge discovery, precision medicine/nursing, and the development of targeted interventions to improve health outcomes. Commonly used methods in big data analytics will be reviewed, and the challenges related to gathering, analyzing, visualizing, and interpreting big data will be discussed. Hands-on computer laboratory experience with these techniques relevant to an identified area will be included.

## COURSE OBJECTIVES

At the end of this course the student will be able to successfully:

1.	Demonstrate knowledge of the principles undergirding the tools of big data analysis in health related research.

2.	Identify the potential of, and challenges to, incorporating big data analytics to improve the development and testing of precision medicine / nursing interventions.

3.	Understand the principles of reproducible research and implement an appropriate workflow for data analysis and manuscript / report generation.

4.	Effectively critique published research of health related studies conducted by using big data theoretical frameworks and research techniques.

5.	Analyze ethical issues related to the use of big data analytics in health related research

6.	Demonstrate knowledge of how data are gathered, stored, managed, and analyzed for big data analytics.

## TEACHING AND LEARNING

This course uses a variety of teaching methods, including readings, case presentations, lectures, practical skills application discussion sessions, simulation, and projects.

## COURSE REQUIREMENTS & ASSIGNMENTS

Successful completion of the course objectives will be determined by performance with the following course assignments:

1.	[Manuscript critiques](./articleCritique.html) For each application area, up to five selected journal articles will be posted; students will be expected to provide a short (one-page) critique for one article from each of the topic areas, each time focusing on the analytic technique used, evaluating its appropriateness, its value added to the study, and any ethical implications for its inclusion. Articles and critiques will be discussed in class.

2.	[Short paper](./shortPaper.html) One short (~10 pages, double-spaced and single-sided) paper detailing a selected big data analytic methodology relevant to the student’s proposed area of research or particular interest.

3.	[Comprehensive Final Project](./finalProject.html) A practicum/exemplar presentation of the student’s skills and knowledge for obtaining, analyzing and presenting results from Big Data sources to address an issue of interest in healthcare.
