## SPSS

Go to IBM’s website for student grad pack versions at https://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/spss-stats-gradpack 

There are several links at this website for purchasing students versions of SPSS. There are 3 options:

* The Base edition (approximately $35); 
* The Standard edition (approximately $49); and
* The Premium edition (approximately $89)

The Standard edition would be the minimal version to purchase as it has the necessary statistical modeling procedures included. However, it is recommended to purchase the Premium Grad Pack which also includes bootstrapping, missing data analysis, customized tables, and other helpful tools. Version 25 is the most current version. Here is a quick comparison between the 3 editions (available at this reseller https://www.hearne.software/Software/SPSS-Grad-Packs-for-Students-by-IBM/Editions)
